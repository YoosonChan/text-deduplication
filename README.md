#### The requirements of `gyp`

We may encounter problems in the system environment that yield installation failure when building the package.

### Description

[Nodejieba](https://github.com/luckykaiyi/nodejieba) is a C++ addon of nodejs. The package from the release package will be downloaded, unpacked, and built when installing nodejieba through npm before the project starts. We may encounter a problem: the package is not found from the download address since the "node-pre-gyp" tools generate a wrong file name according to the [nodejs version](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases). So, we need to ensure that the version matches first.

From the [release page](https://github.com/luckykaiyi/nodejieba/releases/) of nodejieba, the stable and popular download version is [2.5.2](https://github.com/luckykaiyi/nodejieba/releases/tag/v2.5.2). At the same time, nodejieba depends on the specific [Node ABI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-abi) (application binary interface) of nodejs, which are 64, 72, 83, and 88 from the [release package](https://github.com/luckykaiyi/nodejieba/releases/) names similar to  "v-88". We can choose 88 because a high version of Node ABIs from the release packages can be better compatible with other new stable [packages]((https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies)) of the project.
